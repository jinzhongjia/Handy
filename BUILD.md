# Build Instructions

This guide covers how to set up the development environment and build Handy from source across different platforms.

## Prerequisites

### All Platforms

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) package manager
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.21 or newer on `PATH`, and a C++17 compiler
- [Tauri Prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

### Platform-Specific Requirements

#### macOS

- Xcode Command Line Tools
- Install with: `xcode-select --install`
- Install CMake with `brew install cmake`.

The native ASR build downloads a pinned ONNX Runtime SDK for the target architecture, including Intel Macs. To use an existing shared SDK instead, see [X-ASR native runtime](#x-asr-native-runtime).

#### Windows

- Microsoft C++ Build Tools: Visual Studio 2019/2022 with C++ development
  tools, or Visual Studio Build Tools 2019/2022
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (must be on `PATH`):

  ```powershell
  winget install Kitware.CMake
  ```

- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) from LunarG — required to
  build the Vulkan GPU backend (`vulkan-shaders-gen` needs the SDK's headers
  and `glslc`):

  ```powershell
  winget install KhronosGroup.VulkanSDK
  ```

  Open a new terminal afterward so `VULKAN_SDK` is set.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows' 260-character path limit used to break the native Vulkan build in
> most checkouts. Since `transcribe-cpp` 0.1.3 the build works around it
> automatically (it compiles through a short NTFS junction — no admin rights
> or setup needed), so a normal checkout just builds. If you still hit
> path-limit errors, see
> [Windows build fails with path-limit errors](#windows-build-fails-with-path-limit-errors-msb3491--ftk1011--msb6003)
> in Troubleshooting.

#### Linux

- Build essentials
- ALSA development libraries
- Install with:

  ```bash
  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install build-essential clang libclang-dev libevdev-dev libasound2-dev pkg-config libssl-dev libvulkan-dev vulkan-tools glslc spirv-headers glslang-tools libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libgtk-layer-shell0 libgtk-layer-shell-dev patchelf cmake

  # Fedora/RHEL
  sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
  sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel pkgconf openssl-devel vulkan-devel glslc \
    clang clang-devel libevdev-devel \
    spirv-headers-devel spirv-tools-devel glslang \
    gtk3-devel webkit2gtk4.1-devel libappindicator-gtk3-devel librsvg2-devel \
    gtk-layer-shell gtk-layer-shell-devel \
    cmake patchelf

  # Arch Linux
  sudo pacman -S base-devel clang libevdev shaderc spirv-headers glslang alsa-lib pkgconf openssl vulkan-devel \
    gtk3 webkit2gtk-4.1 libappindicator-gtk3 librsvg gtk-layer-shell \
    cmake patchelf
  ```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cjpais/Handy.git
cd Handy
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Start Dev Server

```bash
bun tauri dev
```

### 4. Build for Production

```bash
bun run tauri build
```

This compiles a release binary and generates platform-specific bundles (deb, rpm, AppImage on Linux; dmg on macOS; msi on Windows).

### X-ASR native runtime

`src-tauri/x-asr` builds an ASR-only sherpa-onnx 1.13.8 backend from pinned source. It does not require Python and does not build the TTS/espeak components. X-ASR runs on CPU. Its shared ONNX Runtime is also used by VAD and `transcribe-rs`, rather than linking a second runtime.

The first build downloads native sources and an architecture-specific runtime SDK. Source hashes and offline-build dependencies are recorded in `src-tauri/x-asr/native/dependencies.json`. Nix prefetches these dependencies outside its build sandbox.

Optional build overrides:

| Variable                    | Purpose                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ORT_LIB_LOCATION`          | Directory containing a shared ONNX Runtime library supporting API 24 or newer. Windows also needs its import library.           |
| `ORT_INCLUDE_DIR`           | Matching SDK headers; direct and nested system include layouts are supported.                                                   |
| `ORT_LICENSE_DIR`           | Matching ONNX Runtime license/notices directory when they are not beside the supplied SDK.                                      |
| `HANDY_XASR_SOURCE_DIR`     | Unpacked sherpa source matching the pinned revision.                                                                            |
| `HANDY_XASR_DEPENDENCY_DIR` | Prefetched archives using the filenames in the dependency manifest; may also contain the target's ORT SDK archive.              |
| `HANDY_XASR_NATIVE_DIR`     | An already-built matching Handy X-ASR runtime directory, including its `licenses` directory. Not a stock sherpa binary package. |

The build stages the native bridge, ONNX Runtime and dependency notices in `src-tauri/transcribe-libs`. Tauri bundles the macOS libraries as frameworks; Windows keeps DLLs beside the executable; Linux uses the existing private library directory. Do not distribute only the raw executable.

The two model downloads are independent: `x-asr-zh-en-streaming-480ms` and `x-asr-zh-en-offline-int8`. Offline recordings are segmented at pauses where possible, with a hard maximum of 30 seconds per segment; very short nonempty input is padded to 100 ms. Native exceptions are converted to errors before crossing into Rust.

To exercise the native backend directly with an installed model and a mono 16 kHz WAV:

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -p handy-x-asr --example transcribe -- streaming MODEL_DIRECTORY AUDIO.wav
cargo run --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -p handy-x-asr --example transcribe -- offline MODEL_DIRECTORY AUDIO.wav
```

The streaming command prints live hypotheses and final text. The application itself can also be exercised with `handy --transcribe-file AUDIO.wav --model MODEL_ID --json`.

## Linux Install (from source)

The raw binary (`src-tauri/target/release/handy`) cannot run standalone — it needs Tauri resource files (tray icons, sounds, VAD model) to be co-located at the expected path.

**Install from the deb bundle** (works on any Linux distro):

```bash
cd /tmp
ar x /path/to/Handy/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/Handy_*_amd64.deb data.tar.gz
tar xzf data.tar.gz
sudo cp usr/bin/handy /usr/bin/
sudo cp -a usr/lib/. /usr/lib/
sudo cp -r usr/share/icons/hicolor/* /usr/share/icons/hicolor/
sudo cp usr/share/applications/Handy.desktop /usr/share/applications/
```

The runtime libraries live in the app-private `/usr/lib/Handy/` (on the binary's rpath), so no `ldconfig` step is needed.

After subsequent rebuilds, copy the binary and any refreshed runtime libraries:

```bash
sudo cp src-tauri/target/release/handy /usr/bin/
sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/Handy
sudo cp -a src-tauri/transcribe-libs/. /usr/lib/Handy/
```

Resources only need re-copying if they change upstream (new icons, sounds, models, etc.).

## Troubleshooting

### macOS Accessibility remains enabled after a local rebuild

Local builds use the ad-hoc `signingIdentity: "-"`. A rebuild can have a new macOS code
identity while the old **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility** entry
remains visibly enabled, leaving Handy on `Waiting...`.

After installing the final bundle at `/Applications/Handy.app`, quit Handy, clear only its
stale Accessibility record, then reopen it:

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application id "com.pais.handy" to quit' || true
tccutil reset Accessibility com.pais.handy
open /Applications/Handy.app
```

Grant Accessibility again when prompted. This does not reset Microphone or other TCC
services, and official releases normally do not need it.

For optional diagnosis, compare the designated requirements of the previous and rebuilt
bundles:

```bash
codesign -dr - /path/to/previous/Handy.app 2>&1
codesign -dr - /Applications/Handy.app 2>&1
```

An ad-hoc requirement contains a `cdhash`; a changed requirement confirms the rebuild is
not covered by the old grant. The reset procedure does not require this check.

See [issue #1618](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/1618) for the related onboarding
and stale-permission report.

### AppImage build fails on Arch / rolling-release distros

`linuxdeploy` bundles its own `strip` binary which is too old to process system libraries built with newer toolchains on rolling-release distros (Arch, CachyOS, Manjaro, EndeavourOS).

The error from Tauri:

```
Bundling Handy_*_amd64.AppImage
failed to bundle project `failed to run linuxdeploy`
```

Tauri swallows the real linuxdeploy error. To see it, run linuxdeploy manually:

```bash
cd src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage
~/.cache/tauri/linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run \
  --appdir Handy.AppDir --plugin gtk --output appimage
```

**Workaround:** The binary, deb, and rpm bundles all build fine — only the AppImage step fails. To skip it:

```bash
bun run tauri build -- --bundles deb
```

Then install using the deb extraction method above.

### Windows build fails with path-limit errors (`MSB3491` / `FTK1011` / `MSB6003`)

On Windows the native build can fail partway through `transcribe-cpp-sys` with
any of these (all the same root cause):

```
error MSB3491: Could not write lines to file "...VCTargetsPath.tlog\VCTargetsPath.lastbuildstate".
Path: ... exceeds the OS max path limit. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters.
```

```
FileTracker : error FTK1011: could not create the new file tracking log file:
...\vulkan-shaders-gen-build\...\cmTC_xxxxx.tlog\link.write.1.tlog.
The system cannot find the path specified.
```

```
error MSB6003: The specified task executable "CL.exe" could not be run.
System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path ...
```

This is **not** a code or toolchain problem — it's Windows' legacy 260-character
path limit (`MAX_PATH`), overflowed by the Vulkan shader generator's nested
CMake build tree on top of Cargo's already-deep
`target\release\build\<crate>-<hash>\out\build\...` directory.

Since `transcribe-cpp` 0.1.3 this is mitigated automatically: the native build
compiles through a short NTFS junction under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tcs` (created
without admin rights), so a normal checkout builds with no setup. Enabling
Windows long paths does **not** reliably help here — MSBuild's native
`FileTracker` (`tracker.exe`) ignores the long-paths flag — which is why the
junction, not the registry flag, is the fix.

If you still see the errors above, junction creation was likely blocked
(filesystem or corporate policy) — the failing build's log then contains a
`transcribe-cpp-sys: could not create short build junction ...` warning — or
your checkout is deep enough to overflow even the shortened layout. Work
around either case with a short Cargo target directory:

```powershell
# Per-shell:
$env:CARGO_TARGET_DIR = "C:\h"

# Or persist it for all future terminals (note: redirects ALL your
# Rust projects' build output, not just Handy):
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('CARGO_TARGET_DIR', 'C:\h', 'User')
```

Artifacts then land in `C:\h\release\...` instead of the repo's
`src-tauri\target\`. Open a **new terminal** if you persisted the variable —
it is only picked up by freshly started processes. Then `bun run tauri dev`
and `bun run tauri build` work normally.

### Windows `tauri build` fails at bundling with `program not found`

If the build compiles all the way to `Built application at: ...\handy.exe` and
then fails with:

```
Signing C:\...\handy.exe with a custom signing command
failed to bundle project `program not found`
```

that's the code-signing step: `tauri.conf.json` configures a custom
`signCommand` (`trusted-signing-cli`, Azure Trusted Signing) that only exists
in the release CI environment. Local development doesn't need it:

```powershell
# Development (no bundling/signing at all):
bun run tauri dev

# Or compile a release binary without the installer/signing step:
bun run tauri build --no-bundle
```
